# Problem-Solving
Some problem solving using C programming language

1. WAP to input 10 characters. Each occurrence of a character in the input should be converted  to opposite case i.e. upper to lower case or vice versa.

2. Given an array named A with following elements: 3, -5, 1, 3, 7, 0, -15, 3, -7, -8 WAP to shift the negative numbers to the left and positive numbers to the right so that the resultant array look like the -5, -15, -7, -8, 3, 1, 3, 7, 0, 3 

3. WAP to input two string and find the common character between those two string.(common  character must be printed once) 

4. WAP to find out the product of two matrices. 

5. Write a function to swap the values of two integer variables (1) Using Extra variable (2) Without using extra variable. 

6. Write a function that returns the sum of the following series where x and n are passed to the function as argument.

       1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + …….x^n/n! 

7. Write a C program to print the following pattern using while loop where row number is input from user: \
For row = 5 output will be

1: AA \
2: AABB \
3: AABBCC \
4: AABBCCDD \
5: AABBCCDDEE

8. Define a structure called hotel_info that will describe the following information. Hotel name, address, room type, rent per day using hotel_info, declare an array hotel[structure variable] with 50 elements and write a full  program to read the information of all 50 hotels and print out hotels with room charges less than a  given number. 

9. Write a C program where you have to declare an array of 50 integer values. The program will provide users three choices- input into array, display the elements or exit the program. While taking input you won’t take 50 values as input at the same time. That means your program will support only one input at a time and save it to the first empty index and at starting time it is  index 0. If user chooses the display option, your program will display only that element/ value  which has been inserted at first and after that the element will be deleted from the array. If there are  no values in the array, then your program will show “No values available to delete”. Providing  input and displaying value process will continue as long as the user wants to. The program will  terminate only when user chooses the exit option.
